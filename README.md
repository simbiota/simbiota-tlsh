# TLSH rust reimplementation introducing colored hashes

We reimplemented the [original TLSH](https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh) algorithm in Rust. Our implementation currently is the modified version of the default hash calculation parameters, namely, 1 byte checksum, 128 buckets that result in a 70 character long hash in hexadecimal representation. Note, however, that our implementation supports an extra security feature that we added in order to prevent a recent attack on the TLSH scheme[^1]. As a consequence, the hash value that our implementation produces contains an extra byte compared to the original TLSH hash value, so it is 36 bytes long (i.e., 72 characters long in hexadecimal form) instead of 35 bytes. In the default case, this extra byte added to the beginning of the hash is 0x00, and it can be ignored for the moment; however, it may take other values and we may use this feature in future versions of Simbiota.
